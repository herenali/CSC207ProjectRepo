**1. For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your program adhere to that principle.**
   - **Equitable Use**
       - allows any user with a computer that can run the program to create an account and access all the same features (sending messages, creating chats) as any other user
       - method of storing account/user information (username, password, etc.) are the same for any user and there is no discrimination based on the user's technical proficiency
       - user can choose any username and password they want when creating an account, and no user can choose their unique userID as this is generated by the system to maintain uniformity and between users
   - **Flexibility in Use**
       - can add more accessibility features, such as changing text size, dark mode, and more customizable controls/shortcuts for buttons
       - this would allow program to adapt better to suit the users' needs and avoid any potential challenges with using the program, such as eyesight issues/sensitivity or limited mobility; for example, users with visual impairments can increase the text size while users who find bright screens distracting can switch to dark mode
       - future plans for the program also includes providing speech-to-text option to make the system more accessible to the diverse population 
   - **Simple and Intuitive Use**
       - layout of chats is organized with current chat open taking up most of the screen, with a side bar to select other chats and buttons on top for various other features; this simple layout keeps the focus on the conversations while making navigation user-friendly
       - similar layout to other messaging services makes it more intuitive for those who have used them in the past and minimizes the learning curve
       - limited buttons with clear labels (eg. 'send' 'new chat', 'profile') simplify user interface and makes it easy to complete tasks
   - **Perceptible Information**
       - has different colours for buttons/text input boxes, seperating them from plain text (messages); this helps users distinguish between interactive elements and non-interactive ones more easily 
       - buttons to confirm or submit change are a different colour (blue) than the other buttons (white), making them easier to identify for users
       - contrast between light background colours and dark text colours makes it easily legible and ensures readability for users with poor vision 
   - **Tolerance for Error**
       - pop up error message and allows user to try again if input was not compatible
       - has options to change both username and password after creating an account, so users can change their mind (not permanent)
       - has feature to edit message after sending, in case user made a typo or did not mean to send a message
   - **Low Physical Effort**
       - all features of chat system can be accessed using a keyboard and mouse, so only the users' hands are required to move
       - could add feature implementing speech-to-text functionalities to replace typing, which would require less physical effort since the user only needs to talk instead of type
   - **Size & Space for Approach & Use**
       - main features of chat system are all accesible from main chat page, contained within the window
       - user can use program from any position or angle, as long as they can control the keyboard/mouse and see the computer screen
       - the layout and interface have been optimized for users with motor disabilities by ensuring all the interactive elements (like buttons) are large enough to read and use

**2. Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

   We would market our program towards people who want to chat with others on the computer, which mainly includes teenagers and adults, since they are the most likely to find a chat system useful in their daily lives. Most teenagers and adults are comfortable with computers, and need to communicate with others who also use computers. Younger children may not have access to a computer yet, while older people may not be familiar with using technology or would prefer other means of communications with their friends. However, our program's simple interface and customizable features may appeal to individuals of all ages once they gain more familiarity with it. Although there are already many other chat programs available, we think those who want a simple and intuitive chat system would find the most use out of our program and its features. 

**3. Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**

   Although our program is generally accessible, certain demographics are less likely to use it. As mentioned in question 2, younger children and older people are less likely to use our program since it requires a computer, which many of them may not have or may not feel comfortable using. Another demographic that is not likely to use the chat system are people who have physical or mental disabilities that limit their ability to use/control a keyboard and mouse, since that is required for our program. This may include people who are paralyzed or people who cannot form sentences, as they would have difficulty being able to find use out of our system. Lastly, people in rural or developing areas may encounter challenges accessing the program if they lack reliable internet access. To make our program more inclusive, we plan to implement accessiblity features like speech-to-text and more customizable user interface options.
