## Project Summary 
This project is a chat system that incorporates SendBird API. The goal is to allow users to create 
accounts, manage group chats, send and receive messages, and search or edit past messages. Additionally, users can 
interact with others in real time through the appâ€™s messaging system. Our goal is to provide a simple, user-friendly 
interface for group messaging and individual communication, with features that enhance user experience.
